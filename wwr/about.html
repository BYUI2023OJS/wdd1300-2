                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The Whitewater Rafting Site was Founded by my Father Mr. Jefferson back in 1990. He was a very hard working man back than and his interest in waters was so great that anyone who wants to see him or chat with him had to go out in the near by rivers to locate him.
                        One of his friend from Europe introduce him to the Rafting Business. All alone he knew there was something great about these rivers and at last his best friend revealed what needs to be done.
                        So, the custodian of the rivers near his village he has total control of all and in 1992, after two years of paper work, the first sign board was raised in the enterance of the our village. In 1993 Whitewater Rafting Site had ten employees and ever since then the number has been growing and now the company has some offices along the cities and towns with over 150 employess.
                        Now the company has been operating for almost three decades and we've just create it's own website and it's ready to launge anytime this year 2024.
